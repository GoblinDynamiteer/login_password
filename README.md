#LOGIN AND PASSWORD

---

*Simple personal project for practice C programming.* 

*pw_set* asks for a new username and password. "scrambles" the password and saves data to a .dat-file.

*pw_login* asks for username, and if found in .dat-file, asks for password. Then checks if the entered password is correct!

Cod for masked input of password was taken from:
